# ACC Data App (ver. 2)

## Preamble

As an aspiring data analyst, I wanted to find a way of extracting useful data from *Assetto Corsa Competitzione* to 
help me make proper data-driven decisions; this project is my attempt at doing just that.

This project is essentially a minor re-write of my previous one in an attempt at making it more modular.

## Current State and Objectives

As it stands, the code works and outputs a CSV file with the data I wanted for post-race analysis. I'm currently 
studying data science so as time goes on, I will likely attempt to add more features (perhaps eventually utilising 
machine learning) in order to help with this task and perhaps even make recommendations before or during a race. I'm 
also using this as an excuse to learn more about other popular data science Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy. 

I *don't* envisage it becoming a replacement for proper telemetry programs like MoTeC. At the moment I'm quite happy
with the application polling once a second, but this can be adjusted by changing one variable. 

## Thanks
Directly and indirectly, these people have made this possible. Thank you.
